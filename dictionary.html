<p><h1><a name="spec2"></a>Generic Functions and Methods Dictionary</h1>

<p>This chapter describes each of the functions and generic functions that make
up the CLOS Metaobject Protocol.  The descriptions appear in alphabetical
order with the exception that all the reader generic functions for each kind
of metaobject are grouped together.  So, for example, <b>method-function</b>
would be found with <b>method-qualifiers</b> and other method metaobject
readers under ``Readers for Method Metaobjects.''

<p>The description of functions follows the same form as used in the CLOS
specification.  The description of generic functions is similar to that in the
CLOS specification, but some minor changes have been made in the way methods
are presented.

<p>The following is an example of the format for the syntax description of a
generic function:

<p><b>gf1</b> <i>x</i> <i>y</i> <b><tt>&amp;optional</tt></b> <i>z</i> <b><tt>&amp;key</tt></b> <i>k</i>

<p>This description indicates that <b>gf1</b> is a generic function with two
required parameters, <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, an optional parameter <i>z</i>
and a keyword parameter <i>k</i>.

<p>The description of a generic function includes a description of its behavior.
This provides the general behavior, or protocol of the generic function.  All
methods defined on the generic function, both portable and specified, must
have behavior consistent with this description.

<p>Every generic function described in this section is an instance of the class
<b>standard-generic-function</b> and uses standard method combination.

<p>The description of a generic function also includes descriptions of the
specified methods for that generic function.  In the description of these
methods, a <em>method signature</em> is used to describe the parameters and
parameter specializers of each method. The following is an example of the
format for a method signature:

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <b>gf1</b>
         (<i>x</i> <i>class</i>) <i>y</i> <b><tt>&amp;optional</tt></b> <i>z</i> <b><tt>&amp;key</tt></b> <i>k</i>

<p>This signature indicates that this primary method on the generic function <b>gf1</b> has two required parameters, named <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.  In addition,
there is an optional parameter <i>z</i> and a keyword parameter <i>k</i>.
This signature also indicates that the method's parameter specializers are the
classes named <b>class</b> and <b>t</b>.

<p>The description of each method includes a description of the behavior
particular to that method.

<p>An abbreviated syntax is used when referring to a method defined elsewhere in
the document.  This abbreviated syntax includes the name of the generic
function, the qualifiers, and the parameter specializers.  A reference to the
method with the signature shown above is written as:  <b>gf1 (class t)</b>.

<hr><a name="add-dependent"><i>Generic Function</i> <a href="dictionary.html#add-dependent"><b>add-dependent</b></a></a>

<p><b>Syntax:</b> 

<p><a href="dictionary.html#add-dependent"><b>add-dependent</b></a> <i>metaobject dependent</i>

<p><b>Arguments:</b> 

<p>The <i>metaobject</i> argument is a class or generic function metaobject.

<p>The <i>dependent</i> argument is an object.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>The value returned by this generic function is unspecified.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This generic function adds <i>dependent</i> to the dependents of <i>metaobject</i>.  If <i>dependent</i> is already in the set of dependents it is not
added again (no error is signaled).

<p>The generic function <a href="dictionary.html#map-dependents"><b>map-dependents</b></a> can be called to access the
set of dependents of a class or generic function.  The generic function
<a href="dictionary.html#remove-dependent"><b>remove-dependent</b></a> can be called to remove an object from the set of
dependents of a class or generic function.  The effect of calling <a href="dictionary.html#add-dependent"><b>add-dependent</b></a> or <a href="dictionary.html#remove-dependent"><b>remove-dependent</b></a> while a call to <a href="dictionary.html#map-dependents"><b>map-dependents</b></a> on the same class or generic function is in progress is
unspecified.

<p>The situations in which <a href="dictionary.html#add-dependent"><b>add-dependent</b></a> is called are not specified.

<p><b>Methods:</b> 

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <a href="dictionary.html#add-dependent"><b>add-dependent</b></a> (<i>class</i> standard-class) <i>dependent</i>

<p>No behavior is specified for this method beyond that which is specified for
the generic function.

<p>This method cannot be overridden unless the following methods are
overridden as well:

<p><blockquote>
<b>remove-dependent (standard-class t)</b><br>
<b>map-dependents (standard-class t)</b>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <a href="dictionary.html#add-dependent"><b>add-dependent</b></a> (<i>class</i> funcallable-standard-class) <i>dependent</i>

<p>No behavior is specified for this method beyond that which is specified for
the generic function.

<p>This method cannot be overridden unless the following methods are
overridden as well:

<p><blockquote>
<b>remove-dependent (funcallable-standard-class t)</b><br>
<b>map-dependents (funcallable-standard-class t)</b>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <a href="dictionary.html#add-dependent"><b>add-dependent</b></a> (<i>generic-function</i> standard-generic-function) <i>dependent</i>

<p>No behavior is specified for this method beyond that which is specified for
the generic function.

<p>This method cannot be overridden unless the following methods are
overridden as well:

<p><blockquote>
<b>remove-dependent (standard-generic-function t)</b><br>
<b>map-dependents (standard-generic-function t)</b>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Notes:</b> 

<p>See the ``Dependent Maintenance Protocol'' section for remarks about the use
of this facility.



<hr><a name="add-direct-method"><i>Generic Function</i> <a href="dictionary.html#add-direct-method"><b>add-direct-method</b></a></a>

<p><b>Syntax:</b> 

<p><a href="dictionary.html#add-direct-method"><b>add-direct-method</b></a> <i>specializer method</i>

<p><b>Arguments:</b> 

<p>The <i>specializer</i> argument is a specializer metaobject.

<p>The <i>method</i> argument is a method metaobject.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>The value returned by this generic function is unspecified.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This generic function is called to maintain a set of backpointers from a
specializer to the set of methods specialized to it.  If <i>method</i> is
already in the set, it is not added again (no error is signaled).

<p>This set can be accessed as a list by calling the generic function <b>specializer-direct-methods</b>.  Methods are removed from the set by <a href="dictionary.html#remove-direct-method"><b>remove-direct-method</b></a>.

<p>The generic function <a href="dictionary.html#add-direct-method"><b>add-direct-method</b></a> is called by <a href="dictionary.html#add-method"><b>add-method</b></a>
whenever a method is added to a generic function.  It is called once for each
of the specializers of the method.  Note that in cases where a specializer
appears more than once in the specializers of a method, this generic function
will be called more than once with the same specializer as argument.

<p>The results are undefined if the <i>specializer</i> argument is not one of the
specializers of the <i>method</i> argument.

<p><b>Methods:</b> 

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <a href="dictionary.html#add-direct-method"><b>add-direct-method</b></a> (<i>specializer</i> class)
                               (<i>method</i> method)

<p>This method implements the behavior of the generic function for class
specializers.  No behavior is specified for this method beyond that which is
specified for the generic function.

<p>This method cannot be overridden unless the following methods are
overridden as well:

<p><blockquote>
<b>remove-direct-method (class method)</b><br>
<b>specializer-direct-generic-functions (class)</b><br>
<b>specializer-direct-methods (class)</b>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <a href="dictionary.html#add-direct-method"><b>add-direct-method</b></a>
 (<i>specializer</i> eql-specializer) (<i>method</i> method)

<p>This method implements the behavior of the generic function for <b>eql</b>
specializers.  No behavior is specified for this method beyond that which is
specified for the generic function.



<hr><a name="add-direct-subclass"><i>Generic Function</i> <b>add-direct-subclass</b></a>

<p><b>Syntax:</b> 

<p><a href="dictionary.html#add-direct-subclass"><b>add-direct-subclass</b></a> <i>superclass subclass</i>

<p><b>Arguments:</b> 

<p>The <i>superclass</i> argument is a class metaobject.

<p>The <i>subclass</i> argument is a class metaobject.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>The value returned by this generic function is unspecified.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This generic function is called to maintain a set of backpointers from a class
to its direct subclasses.  This generic function adds <i>subclass</i> to the
set of direct subclasses of <i>superclass</i>.

<p>When a class is initialized, this generic function is called once for each
direct superclass of the class.

<p>When a class is reinitialized, this generic function is called once for each
added direct superclass of the class.  The generic function <a href="dictionary.html#remove-direct-subclass"><b>remove-direct-subclass</b></a> is called once for each deleted direct superclass of
the class.

<p><b>Methods:</b> 

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <a href="dictionary.html#add-direct-subclass"><b>add-direct-subclass</b></a> (<i>superclass</i> class)
                                 (<i>subclass</i> class)

<p>No behavior is specified for this method beyond that which is specified for
the generic function.

<p>This method cannot be overridden unless the following methods are overridden
as well:

<p><blockquote>
<b>remove-direct-subclass (class class)</b><br>
<b>class-direct-subclasses (class)</b>
</blockquote>



<hr><a name="add-method"><i>Generic Function</i> <b>add-method</b></a>

<p><b>Syntax:</b> 

<p><a href="dictionary.html#add-method"><b>add-method</b></a> <i>generic-function method</i>

<p><b>Arguments:</b> 

<p>The <i>generic-function</i> argument is a generic function metaobject.

<p>The <i>method</i> argument is a method metaobject.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>The <i>generic-function</i> argument is returned.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This generic function associates an unattached method with a generic function.

<p>An error is signaled if the lambda list of the method is not congruent with
the lambda list of the generic function.  An error is also signaled if the
method is already associated with some other generic function.

<p>If the given method agrees with an existing method of the generic function on
parameter specializers and qualifiers, the existing method is removed by
calling <a href="dictionary.html#remove-method"><b>remove-method</b></a> before the new method is added.  See the section
of the CLOS Specification called ``Agreement on Parameter Specializers and
Qualifiers'' for a definition of agreement in this context.

<p>Associating the method with the generic function then proceeds in four steps:
(i) add <i>method</i> to the set returned by <b>generic-function-methods</b> and
arrange for <b>method-generic-function</b> to return <i>generic-function</i>;
(ii) call <a href="dictionary.html#add-direct-method"><b>add-direct-method</b></a> for each of the method's specializers; (iii)
call <a href="dictionary.html#compute-discriminating-function"><b>compute-discriminating-function</b></a> and install its result with <a href="dictionary.html#set-funcallable-instance-function"><b>set-funcallable-instance-function</b></a>; and (iv) update the dependents of the
generic function.

<p>The generic function <a href="dictionary.html#add-method"><b>add-method</b></a> can be called by the user or the
implementation.

<p><b>Methods:</b> 

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <a href="dictionary.html#add-method"><b>add-method</b></a> (<i>generic-function</i> standard-generic-function)
                        (<i>method</i> standard-method)

<p>No behavior is specified for this method beyond that which is specified for
the generic function.



<hr><a name="allocate-instance"><i>Generic Function</i> <a href="dictionary.html#allocate-instance"><b>allocate-instance</b></a></a>

<p><b>Syntax:</b> 

<p><a href="dictionary.html#allocate-instance"><b>allocate-instance</b></a> <i>class <b><tt>&amp;rest</tt></b> <i>initargs</i></i>

<p><b>Arguments:</b> 

<p>The <i>class</i> argument is a class metaobject.

<p>The <i>initargs</i> argument consists of alternating initialization argument
names and values.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>The value returned is a newly allocated instance of <i>class</i>.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This generic function is called to create a new, uninitialized instance of a
class.  The interpretation of the concept of an ``uninitialized'' instance
depends on the class metaobject class.

<p>Before allocating the new instance, <b>class-finalized-p</b> is called to
see if <i>class</i> has been finalized.  If it has not been finalized,
<a href="dictionary.html#finalize-inheritance"><b>finalize-inheritance</b></a> is called before the new instance is
allocated.

<p><b>Methods:</b> 

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <a href="dictionary.html#allocate-instance"><b>allocate-instance</b></a>
         (<i>class</i> standard-class) <b><tt>&amp;rest</tt></b> <i>initargs</i>

<p>This method allocates storage in the instance for each slot with allocation
<b>:instance</b>.  These slots are unbound.  Slots with any other allocation
are ignored by this method (no error is signaled).

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <a href="dictionary.html#allocate-instance"><b>allocate-instance</b></a>
         (<i>class</i> funcallable-standard-class) <b><tt>&amp;rest</tt></b> <i>initargs</i>

<p>This method allocates storage in the instance for each slot with allocation
<b>:instance</b>.  These slots are unbound.  Slots with any other allocation
are ignored by this method (no error is signaled).

<p>The funcallable instance function of the instance is undefined---the results
are undefined if the instance is applied to arguments before <a href="dictionary.html#set-funcallable-instance-function"><b>set-funcallable-instance-function</b></a> has been used to set the funcallable
instance function.

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <a href="dictionary.html#allocate-instance"><b>allocate-instance</b></a>
         (<i>class</i> built-in-class) <b><tt>&amp;rest</tt></b> <i>initargs</i>

<p>This method signals an error.



<hr><a name="class-"><i>Generic Function</i> <b>class-...</b></a>

<p>The following generic functions are described together under
<a href="dictionary.html#class-mo-readers">``Readers for Class Metaobjects''</a>:
<b>class-default-initargs</b>, <b>class-direct-default-initargs</b>,
<b>class-direct-slots</b>, <b>class-direct-subclasses</b>,
<b>class-direct-superclasses</b>, <b>class-finalized-p</b>,
<b>class-name</b>, <b>class-precedence-list</b>,
<b>class-prototype</b> and <b>class-slots</b>.


<hr><a name="compute-applicable-methods"><i>Generic Function</i> <a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods"><b>compute-applicable-methods</b></a></a>

<p><b>Syntax:</b> 

<p><a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods"><b>compute-applicable-methods</b></a> <i>generic-function arguments</i>

<p><b>Arguments:</b> 

<p>The <i>generic-function</i> argument is a generic function metaobject.

<p>The <i>arguments</i> argument is a list of objects.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>This generic function returns a possibly empty list of method metaobjects.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This generic function determines the method applicability of a generic
function given a list of required arguments.  The returned list of method
metaobjects is sorted by precedence order with the most specific method
appearing first.  If no methods are applicable to the supplied arguments the
empty list is returned.

<p>When a generic function is invoked, the discriminating function must determine
the ordered list of methods applicable to the arguments.  Depending on the
generic function and the arguments, this is done in one of three ways: using a
memoized value; calling <a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods-using-classes"><b>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</b></a>; or
calling <a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods"><b>compute-applicable-methods</b></a>.  (Refer to the description of <a href="dictionary.html#compute-discriminating-function"><b>compute-discriminating-function</b></a> for the details of this process.)

<p>The <i>arguments</i> argument is permitted to contain more elements than the
generic function accepts required arguments; in these cases the extra
arguments will be ignored.  An error is signaled if <i>arguments</i> contains
fewer elements than the generic function accepts required arguments.

<p>The list returned by this generic function will not be mutated by the
implementation.  The results are undefined if a portable program mutates the
list returned by this generic function.

<p><b>Methods:</b> 

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods"><b>compute-applicable-methods</b></a>
         (<i>generic-function</i> standard-generic-function)
                <i>arguments</i>

<p>This method signals an error if any method of the generic function has a
specializer which is neither a class metaobject nor an <b>eql</b> specializer
metaobject.

<p>Otherwise, this method computes the sorted list of applicable methods
according to the rules described in the section of the CLOS Specification called
``Method Selection and Combination.''

<p>This method can be overridden.  Because of the consistency
requirements between this generic function and
<a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods-using-classes"><b>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</b></a>, doing so may require
also overriding <b>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes
(standard-generic-function t)</b>.



<hr><a name="compute-applicable-methods-using-classes"><i>Generic Function</i> <a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods-using-classes"><b>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</b></a></a>

<p><b>Syntax:</b> 

<p><a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods-using-classes"><b>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</b></a> <i>generic-function classes</i>

<p><b>Arguments:</b> 

<p>The <i>generic-function</i> argument is a generic function metaobject.

<p>The <i>classes</i> argument is a list of class metaobjects.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>This generic function returns two values.  The first is a possibly empty
list of method metaobjects.  The second is either true or false.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This generic function is called to attempt to determine the method
applicability of a generic function given only the classes of the required
arguments.

<p>If it is possible to completely determine the ordered list of applicable
methods based only on the supplied classes, this generic function returns that
list as its first value and true as its second value.  The returned list of
method metaobjects is sorted by precedence order, the most specific method
coming first.  If no methods are applicable to arguments with the specified
classes, the empty list and true are returned.

<p>If it is not possible to completely determine the ordered list of applicable
methods based only on the supplied classes, this generic function returns an
unspecified first value and false as its second value.

<p>When a generic function is invoked, the discriminating function must determine
the ordered list of methods applicable to the arguments.  Depending on the
generic function and the arguments, this is done in one of three ways: using a
memoized value; calling <a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods-using-classes"><b>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</b></a>; or
calling <a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods"><b>compute-applicable-methods</b></a>.  (Refer to the description of <a href="dictionary.html#compute-discriminating-function"><b>compute-discriminating-function</b></a> for the details of this process.)

<p>The following consistency relationship between
<a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods-using-classes"><b>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</b></a> and
<a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods"><b>compute-applicable-methods</b></a> must be maintained: for any given
generic function and set of arguments, if
<a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods-using-classes"><b>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</b></a> returns a second value
of true, the first value must be equal to the value that would be
returned by a corresponding call to <a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods"><b>compute-applicable-methods</b></a>.
The results are undefined if a portable method on either of these
generic functions causes this consistency to be violated.

<p>The list returned by this generic function will not be mutated by the
implementation.  The results are undefined if a portable program mutates the
list returned by this generic function.

<p><b>Methods:</b> 

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods-using-classes"><b>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</b></a>
         (<i>generic-function</i> standard-generic-function)
                <i>classes</i>

<p>If any method of the generic function has a specializer which is neither a
class metaobject nor an <b>eql</b> specializer metaobject, this method signals
an error.

<p>In cases where the generic function has no methods with <b>eql</b>
specializers, or has no methods with <b>eql</b> specializers that could be
applicable to arguments of the supplied classes, this method returns the
ordered list of applicable methods as its first value and true as its second
value.

<p>Otherwise this method returns an unspecified first value and false as its
second value.

<p>This method can be overridden. Because of the consistency requirements between
this generic function and <a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods"><b>compute-applicable-methods</b></a>, doing so may
require also overriding
<b>compute-applicable-methods (standard-generic-function t)</b>.

<p><b>Notes:</b> 

<p>This generic function exists to allow user extensions which alter method
lookup rules, but which base the new rules only on the classes of the required
arguments, to take advantage of the class-based method lookup memoization
found in many implementations.  (There is of course no requirement for an
implementation to provide this optimization.)

<p>Such an extension can be implemented by two methods, one on this generic
function and one on <a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods"><b>compute-applicable-methods</b></a>.  Whenever the user
extension is in effect, the first method will return a second value of true.
This should allow the implementation to absorb these cases into its own
memoization scheme.

<p>To get appropriate performance, other kinds of extensions may
require methods on <a
href="dictionary.html#compute-discriminating-function"><b>compute-discriminating-function</b></a>
which implement their own memoization scheme.



<hr><a name="compute-class-precedence-list"><i>Generic Function</i> <a href="dictionary.html#compute-class-precedence-list"><b>compute-class-precedence-list</b></a></a>

<p><b>Syntax:</b> 

<p><a href="dictionary.html#compute-class-precedence-list"><b>compute-class-precedence-list</b></a> <i>class</i>

<p><b>Arguments:</b> 

<p>The <i>class</i> argument is a class metaobject.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>The value returned by this generic function is a list of class metaobjects.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This generic-function is called to determine the class precedence list of a
class.

<p>The result is a list which contains each of <i>class</i> and its superclasses
once and only once.  The first element of the list is <i>class</i> and the last
element is the class named <b>t</b>.

<p>All methods on this generic function must compute the class precedence
list as a function of the ordered direct superclasses of the
superclasses of <i>class</i>.  The results are undefined if the rules
used to compute the class precedence list depend on any other factors.

<p>When a class is finalized, <a href="dictionary.html#finalize-inheritance"><b>finalize-inheritance</b></a> calls this generic
function and associates the returned value with the class metaobject.
The value can then be accessed by calling <b>class-precedence-list</b>.

<p>The list returned by this generic function will not be mutated by the
implementation.  The results are undefined if a portable program mutates the
list returned by this generic function.

<p><b>Methods:</b> 

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <a href="dictionary.html#compute-class-precedence-list"><b>compute-class-precedence-list</b></a> (<i>class</i> class)

<p>This method computes the class precedence list according to the rules
described in the section of the CLOS Specification called ``Determining the Class
Precedence List.''

<p>This method signals an error if <i>class</i> or any of its superclasses is a
forward referenced class.

<p>This method can be overridden.



<hr><a name="compute-default-initargs"><i>Generic Function</i> <a href="dictionary.html#compute-default-initargs"><b>compute-default-initargs</b></a></a>

<p><b>Syntax:</b> 

<p><a href="dictionary.html#compute-default-initargs"><b>compute-default-initargs</b></a> <i>class</i>

<p><b>Arguments:</b> 

<p>The <i>class</i> argument is a class metaobject.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>The value returned by this generic function is a list of canonicalized default
initialization arguments.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This generic-function is called to determine the default initialization
arguments for a class.

<p>The result is a list of canonicalized default initialization arguments, with
no duplication among initialization argument names.

<p>All methods on this generic function must compute the default initialization
arguments as a function of only: (i) the class precedence list of <i>class</i>,
and (ii) the direct default initialization arguments of each class in that
list.  The results are undefined if the rules used to compute the default
initialization arguments depend on any other factors.

<p>When a class is finalized, <a href="dictionary.html#finalize-inheritance"><b>finalize-inheritance</b></a> calls this generic
function and associates the returned value with the class metaobject.  The
value can then be accessed by calling <b>class-default-initargs</b>.

<p>The list returned by this generic function will not be mutated by the
implementation.  The results are undefined if a portable program mutates the
list returned by this generic function.

<p><b>Methods:</b> 

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <a href="dictionary.html#compute-default-initargs"><b>compute-default-initargs</b></a> (<i>class</i> standard-class)<br>
<i>Primary Method</i> <a href="dictionary.html#compute-default-initargs"><b>compute-default-initargs</b></a> (<i>class</i> funcallable-standard-class)

<p>These methods compute the default initialization arguments according to the
rules described in the section of the CLOS Specification called ``Defaulting
of Initialization Arguments.''

<p>These methods signal an error if <i>class</i> or any of its superclasses is a
forward referenced class.

<p>These methods can be overridden.



<hr><a name="compute-discriminating-function"><i>Generic Function</i> <b>compute-discriminating-function</b></a>

<p><b>Syntax:</b> 

<p><a href="dictionary.html#compute-discriminating-function"><b>compute-discriminating-function</b></a> <i>generic-function</i>

<p><b>Arguments:</b> 

<p>The <i>generic-function</i> argument is a generic function metaobject.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>The value returned by this generic function is a function.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This generic function is called to determine the discriminating function for a
generic function.  When a generic function is called, the <em>installed</em>
discriminating function is called with the full set of arguments received by
the generic function, and must implement the behavior of calling the generic
function:  determining the ordered set of applicable methods, determining the
effective method, and running the effective method.

<p>To determine the ordered set of applicable methods, the
discriminating function first calls
<a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods-using-classes"><b>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</b></a>.  If
<a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods-using-classes"><b>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</b></a> returns a second value
of false, the discriminating function then calls
<a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods"><b>compute-applicable-methods</b></a>.

<p>When <a href="dictionary.html#compute-applicable-methods-using-classes"><b>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</b></a> returns a second value of

<p><b>Syntax:</b> 

<p><a href="dictionary.html#compute-effective-method"><b>compute-effective-method</b></a> <i>generic-function method-combination methods</i>

<p><b>Arguments:</b> 

<p>The <i>generic-function</i> argument is a generic function metaobject.

<p>The <i>method-combination</i> argument is a method combination metaobject.

<p>The <i>methods</i> argument is a list of method metaobjects.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>This generic function returns two values.  The first is an effective method,
the second is a list of effective method options.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This generic function is called to determine the effective method from a
sorted list of method metaobjects.

<p>An effective method is a form that describes how the applicable methods are to
be combined.  Inside of effective method forms are <b>call-method</b> forms
which indicate that a particular method is to be called.  The arguments to the
<b>call-method</b> form indicate exactly how the method function of the method
should be called.  (See <a href="dictionary.html#make-method-lambda"><b>make-method-lambda</b></a> for more details about method
functions.)

<p>An effective method option has the same interpretation and syntax as either
the <b>:arguments</b> or the <b>:generic-function</b> option in the long form of
<b>define-method-combination</b>.

<p>More information about the form and interpretation of effective methods and
effective method options can be found under the description of the <b>define-method-combination</b> macro in the CLOS specification.

<p>This generic function can be called by the user or the implementation.  It is
called by discriminating functions whenever a sorted list of applicable

<p><b>Arguments:</b> 

<p>The <i>class</i> argument is a class metaobject.

<p>The <i>name</i> argument is a slot name.

<p>The <i>direct-slot-definitions</i> argument is an ordered list of direct
slot definition metaobjects.  The most specific direct slot definition
metaobject appears first in the list.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>The value returned by this generic function is an effective slot definition
metaobject.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This generic function determines the effective slot definition for a slot in a
class.  It is called by <a href="dictionary.html#compute-slots"><b>compute-slots</b></a> once for each slot accessible in
instances of <i>class</i>.

<p>This generic function uses the supplied list of direct slot definition
metaobjects to compute the inheritance of slot properties for a single slot.
The returned effective slot definition represents the result of computing the
inheritance.  The name of the new effective slot definition is the same as the
name of the direct slot definitions supplied.

<p>The class of the effective slot definition metaobject is determined
by calling <a href="dictionary.html#effective-slot-definition-class"><b>effective-slot-definition-class</b></a>.  The effective slot
definition is then created by calling <b>make-instance</b>.  The
initialization arguments passed in this call to <b>make-instance</b>
are used to initialize the new effective slot definition metaobject.

<p><b>Arguments:</b> 

<p>The <i>class</i> argument is a class metaobject.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>The value returned is a set of effective slot definition metaobjects.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This generic function computes a set of effective slot definition
metaobjects for the class <i>class</i>.  The result is a list of
effective slot definition metaobjects: one for each slot that will be
accessible in instances of <i>class</i>.

<p>This generic function proceeds in 3 steps:

<p>The first step collects the full set of direct slot definitions from the
superclasses of <i>class</i>.

<p>The direct slot definitions are then collected into individual lists, one list
for each slot name associated with any of the direct slot definitions.  The
slot names are compared with <b>eql</b>.  Each such list is then sorted into
class precedence list order.  Direct slot definitions coming from classes
earlier in the class precedence list of <i>class</i> appear before those coming
from classes later in the class precedence list.  For each slot name, the
generic function <a href="dictionary.html#compute-effective-slot-definition"><b>compute-effective-slot-definition</b></a> is called to compute
an effective slot definition.  The result of <a href="dictionary.html#compute-slots"><b>compute-slots</b></a> is a list of
these effective slot definitions, in unspecified order.

<p>In the final step, the location for each effective slot definition
is set.  This is done by specified around-methods; portable methods
cannot take over this behavior. For more information on the slot
definition locations, see the section <a
href="concepts.html#instance-structure-protocol">``Instance Structure
Protocol.''</a>

<p>The list returned by this generic function will not be mutated by the
implementation.  The results are undefined if a portable program mutates the
list returned by this generic function.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>The result is a class metaobject.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This function is called to define or redefine a class with the specified name,
and can be called by the user or the implementation.  It is the functional

<p>The <b>:metaclass</b> argument is a class metaobject class or a class

class named <b>standard-class</b>.   If a class name is supplied, it is
interpreted as the class with that name.  If a class name is supplied, but
there is no such class, an error is signaled.

<p>The <b>:direct-superclasses</b> argument is a list of which each element is a
class metaobject or a class name.  An error is signaled if this argument is
not a proper list.

<p>For the interpretation of additional keyword arguments, see <a

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>The result is a class metaobject.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This generic function is called to define or modify the definition of a named
class.  It is called by the <a href="dictionary.html#ensure-class"><b>ensure-class</b></a> function.  It can also be
called directly.

<p>The first step performed by this generic function is to compute the set of
initialization arguments which will be used to create or reinitialize the
named class.  The initialization arguments are computed from the full set of
keyword arguments received by this generic function as follows:

<p><ul>
<li> The <b>:metaclass</b> argument is not included in the initialization
arguments.

<p><li> If the <b>:direct-superclasses</b> argument was received by this
generic function, it is converted into a list of class metaobjects.  This
conversion does not affect the structure of the supplied <b>:direct-superclasses</b> argument.  For each element in the <b>:direct-superclasses</b> argument:

<p><ul>

<p><li> If the element is a class metaobject, that class metaobject is used.

<p><li> If the element names a class, that class metaobject is used.

<p><li> Otherwise an instance of the class <b>forward-referenced-class</b> is
created and used.  The proper name of the newly created forward referenced
class metaobject is set to <i>name</i>.

<p></ul>

<p><li> All other keyword arguments are included directly in the initialization
arguments.

<p></ul>

<p>If the <i>class</i> argument is <b>nil</b>, a new class metaobject is created by
calling the <b>make-instance</b> generic function with the value of the <b>:metaclass</b> argument as its first argument, and the previously computed
initialization arguments.  The proper name of the newly created class
metaobject is set to <i>name</i>.  The newly created class metaobject is
returned.

<p>If the <i>class</i> argument is a forward referenced class,
<b>change-class</b> is called to change its class to the value
specified by the <b>:metaclass</b> argument.  The class metaobject is
then reinitialized with the previously computed initialization
arguments.  (This is a documented violation of the general constraint
that <b>change-class</b> not be used with class metaobjects.)

<p>If the class of the <i>class</i> argument is not the same as the class
specified by the <b>:metaclass</b> argument, an error is signaled.

<p>Otherwise, the class metaobject <i>class</i> is redefined by calling the <b>reinitialize-instance</b> generic function with <i>class</i> and the

<hr><a name="</a>"><b>Initialization of Class Metaobjects</b><a name="class-mo-init"></a></a>

<p>A class metaobject can be created by calling <b>make-instance</b>.  The
initialization arguments establish the definition of the class.  A class
metaobject can be redefined by calling <b>reinitialize-instance</b>.  Some
classes of class metaobject do not support redefinition; in these cases,
<b>reinitialize-instance</b> signals an error.

<p>Initialization of a class metaobject must be done by calling
<b>make-instance</b> and allowing it to call
<b>initialize-instance</b>.  Reinitialization of a class metaobject
must be done by calling <b>reinitialize-instance</b>.  Portable
programs must not call <b>initialize-instance</b> directly to
initialize a class metaobject. Portable programs must not call
<b>shared-initialize</b> directly to initialize or reinitialize a
class metaobject.  Portable programs must not call <b>change-class</b>
to change the class of any class metaobject or to turn a non-class
object into a class metaobject.

<p>Since metaobject classes may not be redefined, no behavior is
specified for the result of calls to
<b>update-instance-for-redefined-class</b> on class metaobjects.
Since the class of class metaobjects may not be changed, no behavior
is specified for the result of calls to
<b>update-instance-for-different-class</b> on class metaobjects.

<p>During initialization or reinitialization, each initialization argument is
checked for errors and then associated with the class metaobject.  The value
can then be accessed by calling the appropriate accessor as shown in 
<a href="dictionary.html#class-mo-initargs">Table 1</a>.

<p>This section begins with a description of the error checking and processing
of each initialization argument.  This is followed by a table showing the
generic functions that can be used to access the stored initialization
arguments.  Initialization behavior specific to the different specified
class metaobject classes comes next.  The section ends with a set of
restrictions on portable methods affecting class metaobject initialization and
reinitialization.

<p>In these descriptions, the phrase ``this argument defaults to <i>value</i>''
means that when that initialization argument is not supplied, initialization
or reinitialization is performed as if <i>value</i> had been supplied.  For
some initialization arguments this could be done by the use of default
initialization arguments, but whether it is done this way is not specified.
Implementations are free to define default initialization arguments for
specified class metaobject classes.  Portable programs are free to define
default initialization arguments for portable subclasses of the class <b>class</b>.

<p>Unless there is a specific note to the contrary, then during reinitialization,
if an initialization argument is not supplied, the previously stored value is
left unchanged.

<p><ul>
<li> The <b>:direct-default-initargs</b> argument is a list of
canonicalized default initialization arguments.

<p>An error is signaled if this value is not a proper list, or if any element
of the list is not a canonicalized default initialization argument.

<p>If the class metaobject is being initialized, this argument defaults to the
empty list.

<p><li> The <b>:direct-slots</b> argument is a list of canonicalized
slot specifications.

<p>An error is signaled if this value is not a proper list or if any
element of the list is not a canonicalized slot specification.

<p>After error checking, this value is converted to a list of direct slot
definition metaobjects before it is associated with the class metaobject.
Conversion of each canonicalized slot specification to a direct slot
definition metaobject is a two-step process.  First, the generic function <b>direct-slot-definition-class</b> is called with the class metaobject and the
canonicalized slot specification to determine the class of the new direct slot
definition metaobject; this permits both the class metaobject and the
canonicalized slot specification to control the resulting direct slot
definition metaobject class.  Second, <b>make-instance</b> is applied to the
direct slot definition metaobject class and the canonicalized slot
specification.  This conversion could be implemented as shown in the following
code:

<p><pre>
(defun convert-to-direct-slot-definition (class canonicalized-slot)
  (apply #'make-instance
         (apply #'direct-slot-definition-class
                class canonicalized-slot)
         canonicalized-slot))
</pre>

<p>If the class metaobject is being initialized, this argument defaults to the
empty list.

<p>Once the direct slot definition metaobjects have been created, the specified
reader and writer methods are created.  The generic functions <a href="dictionary.html#reader-method-class"><b>reader-method-class</b></a> and <a href="dictionary.html#writer-method-class"><b>writer-method-class</b></a> are called to determine the
classes of the method metaobjects created.

<p><li> The <b>:direct-superclasses</b> argument is a list of class metaobjects.
Classes which do not support multiple inheritance signal an error if the list
contains more than one element.

<p>An error is signaled if this value is not a proper list or if <b>validate-superclass</b> applied to <i>class</i> and any element of this list
returns false.

<p>When the class metaobject is being initialized, and this argument is either
not supplied or is the empty list, this argument defaults as follows:  if the
class is an instance of <b>standard-class</b> or one of its subclasses the
default value is a list of the class <b>standard-object</b>; if the class is an
instance of <b>funcallable-standard-class</b> or one of its subclasses the
default value is list of the class <b>funcallable-standard-object</b>.

<p>After any defaulting of the value, the generic function <a href="dictionary.html#add-direct-subclass"><b>add-direct-subclass</b></a> is called once for each element of the list.

<p>When the class metaobject is being reinitialized and this argument is
supplied, the generic function <a href="dictionary.html#remove-direct-subclass"><b>remove-direct-subclass</b></a> is called once for
each class metaobject in the previously stored value but not in the new value;
the generic function <a href="dictionary.html#add-direct-subclass"><b>add-direct-subclass</b></a> is called once for each class
metaobject in the new value but not in the previously stored value.

<p><li>  The <b>:documentation</b> argument is a string or <b>nil</b>.

<p>An error is signaled if this value is not a string or <b>nil</b>.

<p>If the class metaobject is being initialized, this argument defaults to <b>nil</b>.

<p><li>  The <b>:name</b> argument is an object.

<p>If the class is being initialized, this argument defaults to <b>nil</b>.

<p></ul>

<p>After the processing and defaulting of initialization arguments described
above, the value of each initialization argument is associated with the class
metaobject.  These values can then be accessed by calling the corresponding
generic function.  The correspondences are as follows:

<p>Instances of the class <b>standard-class</b> support multiple inheritance and
reinitialization.  Instances of the class <b>funcallable-standard-class</b>
support multiple inheritance and reinitialization.  For forward referenced
classes, all of the initialization arguments default to <b>nil</b>.

<p>Since built-in classes cannot be created or reinitialized by the user, an
error is signaled if <b>initialize-instance</b> or <b>reinitialize-instance</b>
are called to initialize or reinitialize a derived instance of the class <b>built-in-class</b>.

<p><b>Methods:</b> 

<p>It is not specified which methods provide the initialization and
reinitialization behavior described above.  Instead, the information needed to

portable initialization methods have access to the class metaobject when
either all or none of the specified initialization has taken effect.

<p>These restrictions govern the methods that a portable program can define
on the generic functions <b>initialize-instance</b>, <b>reinitialize-instance</b>, and <b>shared-initialize</b>.  These restrictions
apply only to methods on these generic functions for which the first
specializer is a subclass of the class <b>class</b>.  Other portable
methods on these generic functions are not affected by these
restrictions.

<p><ul>

<hr><a name="Initialization"><b>Initialization of Slot Definition Metaobjects</b></a>

<p>A slot definition metaobject can be created by calling <b>make-instance</b>.
The initialization arguments establish the definition of the slot definition.
A slot definition metaobject cannot be redefined; calling <b>reinitialize-instance</b> signals an error.

<p>Initialization of a slot definition metaobject must be done by
calling <b>make-instance</b> and allowing it to call
<b>initialize-instance</b>.  Portable programs must not call
<b>initialize-instance</b> directly to initialize a slot definition
metaobject.  Portable programs must not call <b>shared-initialize</b>
directly to initialize a slot definition metaobject.  Portable
programs must not call <b>change-class</b> to change the class of any
slot definition metaobject or to turn a non-slot-definition object
into a slot definition metaobject.

<p>Since metaobject classes may not be redefined, no behavior is
specified for the result of calls to
<b>update-instance-for-redefined-class</b> on slot definition
metaobjects.  Since the class of a slot definition metaobject cannot
be changed, no behavior is specified for the result of calls to
<b>update-instance-for-different-class</b> on slot definition
metaobjects.

<p>During initialization, each initialization argument is checked for
errors and then associated with the slot definition metaobject.  The
value can then be accessed by calling the appropriate accessor as
shown in <a href="dictionary.html#slotd-mo-initargs">Table 4</a>.

<p>This section begins with a description of the error checking and processing of
each initialization argument.  This is followed by a table showing the generic
functions that can be used to access the stored initialization arguments.

<p>In these descriptions, the phrase ``this argument defaults to <i>value</i>''
means that when that initialization argument is not supplied, initialization
is performed as if <i>value</i> had been supplied.  For some initialization
arguments this could be done by the use of default initialization arguments,
but whether it is done this way is not specified.  Implementations are free to
define default initialization arguments for specified slot definition
metaobject classes.  Portable programs are free to define default
initialization arguments for portable subclasses of the class <b>slot-definition</b>.

<p><ul>

<p><li> The <b>:name</b> argument is a slot name.  An error is signaled if this
argument is not a symbol which can be used as a variable name.  An error is
signaled if this argument is not supplied.

<p><li> The <b>:initform</b> argument is a form. The <b>:initform</b> argument
defaults to <b>nil</b>.  An error is signaled if the <b>:initform</b> argument is
supplied, but the <b>:initfunction</b> argument is not supplied.

<p><li> The <b>:initfunction</b> argument is a function of zero arguments which,
when called, evaluates the <b>:initform</b> in the appropriate lexical
environment.  The <b>:initfunction</b> argument defaults to false.  An error is
signaled if the <b>:initfunction</b> argument is supplied, but the <b>:initform</b> argument is not supplied.

<p><li> The <b>:type</b> argument is a type specifier name.  An error is
signaled otherwise.  The <b>:type</b> argument defaults to the symbol <b>t</b>.

<p><li> The <b>:allocation</b> argument is a symbol.  An error is signaled
otherwise.  The <b>:allocation</b> argument defaults to the symbol <b>:instance</b>.

<p><li> The <b>:initargs</b> argument is a list of symbols.  An error is
signaled if this argument is not a proper list, or if any element of this
list is not a symbol.  The <b>:initargs</b> argument defaults to the empty
list.

<p><li> The <b>:readers</b> argument is a list of function names.  An error is
signaled if it is not a proper list, or if any element is not a valid
function name. It defaults to the empty list.  An error is signaled if this
argument is supplied and the metaobject is not a direct slot definition.

<p><li> The <b>:writers</b> argument is a list of function names.  An error is
signaled if it is not a proper list, or if any element is not a valid
function name. It defaults to the empty list.  An error is signaled if this
argument is supplied and the metaobject is not a direct slot definition.

<p><li> The <b>:documentation</b> argument is a string or <b>nil</b>.  An
error is signaled otherwise.  The <b>:documentation</b> argument defaults to
<b>nil</b>.

<p></ul>

<p>After the processing and defaulting of initialization arguments described
above, the value of each initialization argument is associated with the slot
definition metaobject.  These values can then be accessed by calling the
corresponding generic function.  The correspondences are as follows:

<p><b>Methods:</b> 

<p>It is not specified which methods provide the initialization and
reinitialization behavior described above.  Instead, the information needed to
allow portable programs to specialize this behavior is presented as a set of
restrictions on the methods a portable program can define.  The model is that
portable initialization methods have access to the slot definition metaobject
when either all or none of the specified initialization has taken effect.

<p>These restrictions govern the methods that a portable program can define on
the generic functions <b>initialize-instance</b>, <b>reinitialize-instance</b>,
and <b>shared-initialize</b>.  These restrictions apply only to methods on
these generic functions for which the first specializer is a subclass of the
class <b>slot-definition</b>.  Other portable methods on these generic
functions are not affected by these restrictions.

<p><ul>
<li> Portable programs must not define methods on <b>shared-initialize</b> or
<b>reinitialize-instance</b>.

<p><li> For <b>initialize-instance</b>:

<p><ul>

<p><li> Portable programs must not define primary methods.

<p><li> Portable programs may define around-methods, but these must be

<hr><a name="intern-eql-specializer"><i>Function</i> <b>intern-eql-specializer</b></a>

<p><b>Syntax:</b> 

<p><b>intern-eql-specializer</b> <i>object</i>

<p><b>Arguments:</b> 

<p>The <i>object</i> argument is any Lisp object.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>The result is the <b>eql</b> specializer metaobject for <i>object</i>.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This function returns the unique <b>eql</b> specializer metaobject for <i>object</i>, creating one if necessary.  Two calls to <b>intern-eql-specializer</b>
with <b>eql</b> arguments will return the same (i.e., <b>eq</b>) value.

<p><b>Notes:</b> 

<p>The result of calling <b>eql-specializer-object</b> on the result of a call to
<b>intern-eql-special-izer</b> is only guaranteed to be <b>eql</b> to the
original <i>object</i> argument, not necessarily <b>eq</b>.



<hr><a name="make-instance"><i>Generic Function</i> <b>make-instance</b></a>

<p><b>Syntax:</b> 

<p><b>make-instance</b> <i>class <b><tt>&amp;rest</tt></b> <i>initargs</i></i>

<p><b>Arguments:</b> 

<p>The <i>class</i> argument is a class metaobject or a class name.

<p>The <i>initargs</i> argument is a list of alternating initialization argument
names and values.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>The result is a newly allocated and initialized instance of <i>class</i>.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>The generic function <b>make-instance</b> creates and returns a new instance of
the given class.  Its behavior and use is described in the CLOS specification.

<p><b>Methods:</b> 

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <b>make-instance</b> (<i>class</i> symbol) <b><tt>&amp;rest</tt></b> <i>initargs</i>

<p>This method simply invokes <b>make-instance</b> recursively on the arguments
<b>(find-class <i>class</i>)</b> and <i>initargs</i>.

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <b>make-instance</b> (<i>class</i> standard-class) <b><tt>&amp;rest</tt></b> <i>initargs</i><br>
<i>Primary Method</i> <b>make-instance</b> (<i>class</i> funcallable-standard-class) <b><tt>&amp;rest</tt></b> <i>initargs</i>

<p>These methods implement the behavior of <b>make-instance</b> described in the
CLOS specification section named ``Object Creation and Initialization.''



<hr><a name="make-method-lambda"><i>Generic Function</i> <b>make-method-lambda</b></a>

<p><b>Syntax:</b> 

<p><a href="dictionary.html#make-method-lambda"><b>make-method-lambda</b></a> <i>generic-function method lambda-expression environment</i>

<p><b>Arguments:</b> 

<p>The <i>generic-function</i> argument is a generic function metaobject.

<p>The <i>method</i> argument is a (possibly uninitialized) method metaobject. 

<p>The <i>lambda-expression</i> argument is a lambda expression.

<p>The <i>environment</i> argument is the same as the <b>&amp;environment</b> argument
to macro expansion functions.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>This generic function returns two values.  The first is a lambda expression,
the second is a list of initialization arguments and values.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This generic function is called to produce a lambda expression which can
itself be used to produce a method function for a method and generic function
with the specified classes.  The generic function and method the method
function will be used with are not required to be the given ones.  Moreover,
the method metaobject may be uninitialized.

<p>Either the function <b>compile</b>, the special form <b>function</b> or the
function <b>coerce</b> must be used to convert the lambda expression to a method
function.  The method function itself can be applied to arguments with <b>apply</b> or <b>funcall</b>.

<p>When a method is actually called by an effective method, its first argument
will be a list of the arguments to the generic function.  Its remaining
arguments will be all but the first argument passed to <b>call-method</b>.  By
default, all method functions must accept two arguments: the list of arguments
to the generic function and the list of next methods.

<p>For a given generic function and method class, the applicable methods on <a href="dictionary.html#make-method-lambda"><b>make-method-lambda</b></a> and <a href="dictionary.html#compute-effective-method"><b>compute-effective-method</b></a> must be consistent in
the following way:  each use of <b>call-method</b> returned by the method on
<a href="dictionary.html#compute-effective-method"><b>compute-effective-method</b></a> must have the same number of arguments, and the
method lambda returned by the method on <a href="dictionary.html#make-method-lambda"><b>make-method-lambda</b></a> must accept a
corresponding number of arguments.

<p>Note that the system-supplied implementation of <b>call-next-method</b> is not
required to handle extra arguments to the method function.  Users who define
additional arguments to the method function must either redefine or forego
<b>call-next-method</b>.  (See the example below.)

<p>When the method metaobject is created with <b>make-instance</b>, the method
function must be the value of the <b>:function</b> initialization argument.
The additional initialization arguments, returned as the second value of this
generic function, must also be passed in this call to <b>make-instance</b>.

<p><b>Methods:</b> 

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <a href="dictionary.html#make-method-lambda"><b>make-method-lambda</b></a> (<i>generic-function</i> standard-generic-function)
                                     (<i>method</i> standard-method)
                                     <i>lambda-expression</i>
                                     <i>environment</i>

<p>This method returns a method lambda which accepts two arguments, the list of
arguments to the generic function, and the list of next methods.  What
initialization arguments may be returned in the second value are unspecified.

<p>This method can be overridden.


<p>This example shows how to define a kind of method which, from within the body
of the method, has access to the actual method metaobject for the method.
This simplified code overrides whatever method combination is specified for
the generic function, implementing a simple method combination supporting only
primary methods, <b>call-next-method</b> and <b>next-method-p</b>.  (In
addition, its a simplified version of <b>call-next-method</b> which does no
error checking.)

<p>Notice that the extra lexical function bindings get wrapped around the body
before <b>call-next-method</b> is called.  In this way, the user's definition
of <b>call-next-method</b> and <b>next-method-p</b> are sure to override the
system's definitions.

<hr><a name="class-mo-readers"><b>Readers for Class Metaobjects</b></a>

<p>In this and the immediately following sections, the ``reader'' generic
functions which simply return information associated with a particular kind of
metaobject are presented together.  General information is presented first,
followed by a description of the purpose of each, and ending with the
specified methods for these generic functions.

<p>The reader generic functions which simply return information associated with
class metaobjects are presented together in this section.

<p>Each of the reader generic functions for class metaobjects has the same
syntax, accepting one required argument called <i>class</i>, which must be an
class metaobject; otherwise, an error is signaled.  An error is also
signaled if the class metaobject has not been initialized.

<p>These generic functions can be called by the user or the implementation.

<p>For any of these generic functions which returns a list, such lists will not
be mutated by the implementation.  The results are undefined if a portable
program allows such a list to be mutated.

<p><i>Generic Function</i> <b>class-default-initargs</b> <i>class</i>

<p>Returns a list of the default initialization arguments for <i>class</i>.
Each element of this list is a canonicalized default initialization
argument.  The empty list is returned if <i>class</i> has no default
initialization arguments.

<p>During finalization <a href="dictionary.html#finalize-inheritance"><b>finalize-inheritance</b></a> calls <a href="dictionary.html#compute-default-initargs"><b>compute-default-initargs</b></a> to compute the default initialization arguments for
the class.  That value is associated with the class metaobject and is returned
by <b>class-default-initargs</b>.

<p>This generic function signals an error if <i>class</i> has not been finalized.

<p><i>Generic Function</i> <b>class-direct-default-initargs</b> <i>class</i>

<p>Returns a list of the direct default initialization arguments for <i>class</i>.
Each element of this list is a canonicalized default initialization argument.
The empty list is returned if <i>class</i> has no direct default initialization
arguments.  This is the defaulted value of the <b>:direct-default-initargs</b>
initialization argument that was associated with the class during
initialization or reinitialization.

<p><i>Generic Function</i> <b>class-direct-slots</b> <i>class</i>

<p>Returns a set of the direct slots of <i>class</i>.  The elements of this set
are direct slot definition metaobjects.  If the class has no direct slots, the
empty set is returned.  This is the defaulted value of the <b>:direct-slots</b>
initialization argument that was associated with the class during
initialization and reinitialization.

<p><i>Generic Function</i> <b>class-direct-subclasses</b> <i>class</i>

<p>Returns a set of the direct subclasses of <i>class</i>. The elements of this
set are class metaobjects that all mention this class among their direct
superclasses.  The empty set is returned if <i>class</i> has no direct
subclasses.  This value is maintained by the generic functions <a href="dictionary.html#add-direct-subclass"><b>add-direct-subclass</b></a> and <a href="dictionary.html#remove-direct-subclass"><b>remove-direct-subclass</b></a>.

<p><i>Generic Function</i> <b>class-direct-superclasses</b> <i>class</i>

<p>Returns a list of the direct superclasses of <i>class</i>.  The elements of
this list are class metaobjects.  The empty list is returned if <i>class</i>
has no direct superclasses.  This is the defaulted value of the <b>:direct-superclasses</b> initialization argument that was associated with the
class during initialization or reinitialization.

<p><i>Generic Function</i> <b>class-finalized-p</b> <i>class</i>

<p>Returns true if <i>class</i> has been finalized.  Returns false otherwise.
Also returns false if the class has not been initialized.

<p><i>Generic Function</i> <b>class-name</b> <i>class</i>

<p>Returns the name of <i>class</i>.  This value can be any Lisp object, but is
usually a symbol, or <b>nil</b> if the class has no name.  This is the
defaulted value of the <b>:name</b> initialization argument that was associated
with the class during initialization or reinitialization.  (Also see <a href="dictionary.html#(setf class-name)"><b>(setf class-name)</b></a>.)

<p><i>Generic Function</i> <b>class-precedence-list</b> <i>class</i>

<p>Returns the class precedence list of <i>class</i>.  The elements of this list
are class metaobjects.

<p>During class finalization <a href="dictionary.html#finalize-inheritance"><b>finalize-inheritance</b></a> calls <a href="dictionary.html#compute-class-precedence-list"><b>compute-class-precedence-list</b></a> to compute the class precedence list of the
class.  That value is associated with the class metaobject and is returned by
<b>class-precedence-list</b>.

<p>This generic function signals an error if <i>class</i> has not been finalized.

<p><i>Generic Function</i> <b>class-prototype</b> <i>class</i>

<p>Returns a prototype instance of <i>class</i>.  Whether the instance is
initialized is not specified.  The results are undefined if a portable program
modifies the binding of any slot of prototype instance.

<p>This generic function signals an error if <i>class</i> has not been finalized.

<p><i>Generic Function</i> <b>class-slots</b> <i>class</i>

<p>Returns a possibly empty set of the slots accessible in instances of <i>class</i>.  The elements of this set are effective slot definition metaobjects.

<p>During class finalization <a href="dictionary.html#finalize-inheritance"><b>finalize-inheritance</b></a> calls <a href="dictionary.html#compute-slots"><b>compute-slots</b></a>
to compute the slots of the class.  That value is associated with the class
metaobject and is returned by <b>class-slots</b>.

<p>This generic function signals an error if <i>class</i> has not been finalized.

<p><b>Methods:</b> 

<p>The specified methods for the class metaobject reader generic functions are

<hr><a name="gf-mo-readers"><b>Readers for Generic Function Metaobjects</b></a>

<p>The reader generic functions which simply return information associated with
generic function metaobjects are presented together in this section.

<p>Each of the reader generic functions for generic function metaobjects has the
same syntax, accepting one required argument called <i>generic-function</i>,
which must be a generic function metaobject; otherwise, an error is signaled.
An error is also signaled if the generic function metaobject has not been
initialized.

<p>These generic functions can be called by the user or the implementation.

<p>The list returned by this generic function will not be mutated by the
implementation.  The results are undefined if a portable program mutates the
list returned by this generic function.

<p><i>Generic Function</i> <b>generic-function-argument-precedence-order</b> <i>generic-function</i>

<p>Returns the argument precedence order of the generic function.   This value is
a list of symbols, a permutation of the required parameters in the lambda list
of the generic function.  This is the defaulted value of the <b>:argument-precedence-order</b> initialization argument that was associated with
the generic function metaobject during initialization or reinitialization.

<p><i>Generic Function</i> <b>generic-function-declarations</b> <i>generic-function</i>

<p>Returns a possibly empty list of the declarations of the generic function.
The elements of this list are declarations.  This list is the defaulted value

the generic function metaobject during initialization or reinitialization.

<p><i>Generic Function</i> <b>generic-function-lambda-list</b> <i>generic-function</i>

<p>Returns the lambda list of the generic function.  This is the defaulted value
of the <b>:lambda-list</b> initialization argument that was associated with the
generic function metaobject during initialization or reinitialization.  An
error is signaled if the lambda list has yet to be supplied.

<a name="generic-function-method-class"><p><i>Generic Function</i> <b>generic-function-method-class</b> <i>generic-function</i></a>

<p>Returns the default method class of the generic function.  This class must be
a subclass of the class <b>method</b>.  This is the defaulted value of the <b>:method-class</b> initialization argument that was associated with the generic
function metaobject during initialization or reinitialization.

<p><i>Generic Function</i> <b>generic-function-method-combination</b> <i>generic-function</i>

<p>Returns the method combination of the generic function.  This is a method
combination metaobject.  This is the defaulted value of the <b>:method-combination</b> initialization argument that was associated with the
generic function metaobject during initialization or reinitialization.

<p><i>Generic Function</i> <b>generic-function-methods</b> <i>generic-function</i>

<p>Returns the set of methods currently connected to the generic function.  This
is a set of method metaobjects.  This value is maintained by the generic
functions <a href="dictionary.html#add-method"><b>add-method</b></a> and <a href="dictionary.html#remove-method"><b>remove-method</b></a>.

<p><i>Generic Function</i> <b>generic-function-name</b> <i>generic-function</i>

<p>Returns the name of the generic function, or <b>nil</b> if the
generic function has no name.  This is the defaulted value of the

<p><b>Arguments:</b> 

<p>The <i>metaobject</i> argument is a class or generic function metaobject.  It
is the metaobject being reinitialized or otherwise modified.

<p>The <i>dependent</i> argument is an object.  It is the dependent being updated.

<p>The <i>initargs</i> argument is a list of the initialization arguments for
the metaobject redefinition.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>The value returned by <a href="dictionary.html#update-dependent"><b>update-dependent</b></a> is unspecified.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This generic function is called to update a dependent of <i>metaobject</i>.

<p>When a class or a generic function is reinitialized each of its dependents is
updated.  The <i>initargs</i> argument to <a href="dictionary.html#update-dependent"><b>update-dependent</b></a> is the set of
initialization arguments received by <b>reinitialize-instance</b>.

<p>When a method is added to a generic function, each of the generic function's
dependents is updated.  The <i>initargs</i> argument is a list of two elements:
the symbol <a href="dictionary.html#add-method"><b>add-method</b></a>, and the method that was added.

<p>When a method is removed from a generic function, each of the generic
function's dependents is updated.  The <i>initargs</i> argument is a list of
two elements:  the symbol <a href="dictionary.html#remove-method"><b>remove-method</b></a>, and the method that was
removed.

<p>In each case, <a href="dictionary.html#map-dependents"><b>map-dependents</b></a> is used to call <a href="dictionary.html#update-dependent"><b>update-dependent</b></a> on
each of the dependents.  So, for example, the update of a generic function's
dependents when a method is added could be performed by the following code:

<p><pre>
  (map-dependents<em> generic-function</em>
                  #'(lambda (dep)
                      (update-dependent<em> generic-function</em>

<p>The <i>class</i> argument is a class metaobject.

<p>The <i>superclass</i> argument is a class metaobject.

<p><b>Values:</b> 

<p>This generic function returns true or false.

<p><b>Purpose:</b> 

<p>This generic function is called to determine whether the class <i>superclass</i> is suitable for use as a superclass of <i>class</i>.

<p>This generic function can be be called by the implementation or user code.  It
is called during class metaobject initialization and reinitialization, before
the direct superclasses are stored.  If this generic function returns false,
the initialization or reinitialization will signal an error.

<p><b>Methods:</b> 

<p><i>Primary Method</i> <b>validate-superclass</b>      (<i>class</i> class)
                                      (<i>superclass</i> class)

<p>This method returns true in three situations:

<p><dl>

<dd>(i) If the <i>superclass</i> argument is the class named <b>t</b>,

<dd>(ii) if the class of the <i>class</i> argument is the same as the class
of the <i>superclass</i> argument or

<dd>(iii) if the classes one of the arguments is <b>standard-class</b> and
the class of the other is <b>funcallable-standard-class</b>.

</dl>

<p>In all other cases, this method returns false.

<p>This method can be overridden.

<p><b>Notes:</b> 

<p>Defining a method on <b>validate-superclass</b> requires detailed knowledge of
of the internal protocol followed by each of the two class metaobject classes.
A method on <b>validate-superclass</b> which returns true for two different
class metaobject classes declares that they are compatible.
